### Breast Cancer Detection using machine learning

Pinklet is a program that allows the patient to instantly detect whether she has Breast Cancer(BC). The program is app based, where it will allow the user to upload image and get herself tested for BC . 

Breast Cancer (BC) is a common cancer for women around the world, and early detection of BC can greatly improve prognosis and survival chances by promoting clinical treatment to patients early. So itâ€™s amazing to be able to possibly help save lives just by using data, python, and machine learning.

## How it works:
1. The program will run on google colab , so google.colab library must be imported and the data should be loaded to it from the .csv file.
1. Get a count of the number of patients with Malignant (M) cancerous and Benign (B) non-cancerous cells , this can b taken from the 'diagnosis' column.
